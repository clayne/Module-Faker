Revision history for Module-Faker

{{$NEXT}}

0.022     2019-04-28 15:04:47+01:00 Europe/London
        - add meta_munger facility to allow creation of really weird metadata

0.021     2019-04-27 00:16:46+01:00 Europe/London
        - add Dist->from_struct, for making faked dists on the fly
        - support multiple "styles" for packages, like "block" for
          "package PackageName 1.2 { ... }"
        - populate the "file" entry in provides by using the package name,
          when it's left blank in the dist source
        - replace use of auto_deref with Moose native traits
        - added the "more_metadata" property on Dists, which gets merged into
          the generated META file
        - Dist now has include_provides_in_meta, defaulting false, controlling
          whether "provides" are put into META files.  It's false to help act
          more like real life, where provides is very rare.

0.020     2018-04-22 21:59:37+02:00 Europe/Oslo
        - x_authority, provides, and prereqs will no longer be present in the
          META for built dists unless they're defined

        - require a newer CPAN::Meta

0.015     2013-10-22 18:53:18 America/New_York
          [THIS MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]
        - Adds META.json and CPAN::META::Spec v2 support (thanks, David
          Golden!)  If you were using ->provides to get objects, you should now
          use ->packages instead.

          basically a misunderstood and deprecated namespace

0.002     2008-03-13
          support perl 5.8
          apparently my employers want to be able to use this code that I wrote

0.001     2008-03-13
